# 2048 Game by GLOBANT in Telefonica 42 Malaga

My implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game.
Version TRON EDITION, built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
Made in 2 days as part of the Telefónica 42 Málaga program for Globant.

## How to play dude!

Use arrow keys to move tiles.
When two tiles with the same number touch,
they merge into one. Try to reach 2048 Tron edition!
